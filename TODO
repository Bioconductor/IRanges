- Move the "reverse" and "coverage" generics and methods for IRanges objects
  from the Biostrings package to this package.

- Data structures:
  - Ranges, abstract parent of all range structures
  - RangesImpl partially implements Ranges
    - contains environment of vectors on ranges, each vector has "gap value"
    - with optional reference to a tree for searching
  - RangesCollection as collection of Ranges objects, extends Ranges?
  - RangesMatching, encodes matching between ranges,
    - Extends RangesCollection and maybe graph?
  - SeqRanges, ranges on a genomic sequence
    - Extends RangesCollection, element for each chromosome/strand
  - RectRanges, RangesCollection of two Ranges, one for each dimension
  - PolyRanges, list of real-valued matrices, each holding one polygon?

- Ranges methods:
  - "append" or "c" for concatenation
  - "unique" for removing duplicate ranges
  - "findInterval" for points that fall into a normal Ranges
  - "overlap" for finding regions that overlap
  - "nearest" for finding nearest neighbors 
  - "intersect" or "&" for finding the completely overlapping subregions
  - "setdiff" or "-" for subtracting the overlap from first argument
  - "!" as alias for "gaps"
  - "merge" or "|" for merging, i.e. reduce(c(x, y))
  - "split" and "unsplit" for working with categories/clusters
    - operate on RangesCollection objects, not lists
  - "unroll" like "inverse.rle", generates vector from values on ranges
    - if no value specified, could be logical vector, TRUE in range else FALSE
  - "sort" sorts by start or end and returns result as TreeRanges

- RangesCollection methods:
  - "c", "split", "unsplit", "unlist", ... like other R collections
  - binary ops: "overlap", "nearest", "intersect", "setdiff", "merge"
    - 'y' omitted: become n-ary ops on items in collection
    - 'y' specified: performed element-wise
  - unary ops: "gaps" are vectorized
  - "rngapply" for applying over each element
  
- RangeMatching methods:
  - "lmatched" and "rmatched", which matched (either side)
  - "as.matrix", perhaps delegates to "edgeMatrix" to extract matches
  - "clusters", perhaps delegates to "connComp" to group matched ranges
  - "relations" to extract relationships in terms of Allen's Interval Algebra
    - kind of like "all.equal"

- SeqRanges methods:
  - "chrapply" for applying over each chromosome (no it's not crap)
    - "strand" whether to combine strands from same chromosome
    - "exclude" to skip chromsomes by pattern
    - "masks" applied to each element
      - named elements in 'values' combined via expand.grid()

- IRanges constructors:
  - From 'rle' object
