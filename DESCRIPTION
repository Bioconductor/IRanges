Package: IRanges
Title: Infrastructure for manipulating intervals on sequences
Description: The package provides efficient low-level and highly reusable S4
	classes for storing ranges of integers, RLE vectors (Run-Length
	Encoding), and, more generally, data that can be organized
	sequentially (formally defined as Vector objects), as well as views
	on these Vector objects.
	Efficient list-like classes are also provided for storing big
	collections of instances of the basic classes. All classes in
	the package use consistent naming and share the same rich and
	consistent "Vector API" as much as possible.
