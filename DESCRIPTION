Package: IRanges
Title: Low-level containers for storing sets of integer ranges
Description: The IRanges class and its extensions are low-level containers
	for storing sets of integer ranges. A typical use of these containers
	in biology is for representing a set of chromosome regions.
	More specific extensions of the IRanges class will typically
	allow the storage of additional information attached to each
	chromosome region as well as a hierarchical relationship between
	these regions.
