CHANGES IN VERSION 1.12.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Add "relist" method that works on a List skeleton.

    o Add XDoubleViews class with support of most of the functionalities
      available for XIntegerViews.

    o c() now works on XInteger and XDouble objects (in addition to XRaw
      objects).

    o Add min, max, mean, sum, which.min, which.max methods as synonyms for
      the view* functions.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o Views and RleViewsList classes don't derive from IRanges and IRangesList
      classes anymore.

    o When used on a List or a list, togroup() now returns an integer vector
      (instead of a factor) for consistency with what it does on other
      objects (e.g. on a Partitioning object).

    o Move compact() generic from Biostrings to IRanges.

    o Drop deprecated 'multiple' argument from "findOverlaps" methods.

    o Drop deprecated 'start' and 'symmetric' arguments from "resize" method
      for Ranges objects.

DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

   o Using as.data.frame() and or as( , "data.frame") on an AtomicList
     object is deprecated.

   o Deprecate all coercion methods from AtomicList to atomic vectors.
     Those methods were unlisting the object, which can still be done with
     unlist().

   o Deprecate the Binning class.

   o Remove defunct overlap() and countOverlap().

BUG FIXES

   o togroup() on a List or a list does not look at the names anymore to infer
     the grouping, only at the shape of the list-like object.

   o Fix 'relist(IRanges(), IRangesList())'.

   o Fix 'rep.int(Rle(), integer(0))'.

   o Fix some long-standing issues with the XIntegerViews code (better
     handling of "out of limits" or empty views, overflows, NAs).
